# Durham Person Computer Users Club (DPCUC)

I am trying out an idea suggested to me by my good friend Bret Walters.

This repository will be used to contain various publications and 
other information related to presenetation made by me and whare 
appropriate, others as well.

This information will normally take the form of mark-down files
that will guide club members to the documents and other information
they are seeking.
