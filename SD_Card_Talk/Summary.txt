One of the amazing bits of tech we all take
for granted is the SD memory card. These tiny
storage systems enable a wide variety of 
devices from cameras, smart phones, to small
credit card sized computers.

In this talk we take a look at these devices
including where they came from and what you 
will need to know about how they are used 
and what performance you will need and what 
levels you don't need to pay extra for.

Unlike USB thumb drives, SD cards tell us a
great deal about the performance they are
designed to deliver and this information can
be very useful in making an educated choice.

Like all things, there is also a dark side
to this tech. We will also look at SD card
hacking and counterfeiting and what can be
done to avoid grief.
