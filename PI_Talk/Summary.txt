The Raspberry PI is a compact, inexpensive computer that
has taken the world by storm. It is one brand among dozens
of these little credit card sized machines that seem to
multiply at an incredible rate.

fit it? What are they good at?

In this talk we will examine the credit card sized computer

can be useful and who will find it effective and who will
find it gathering dust.
