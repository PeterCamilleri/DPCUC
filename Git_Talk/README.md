This talk was given at the March 2019 general meeting of the DPCUC. It has
the sad distinction of being the last, in-person meeting to occur before
the restrictions of the Covid-19 pandemic hit us all.

The presentation is contained in the file [**DPCUC_Talk_20_03_12.pdf**](./DPCUC_Talk_20_03_12.pdf).

Since this repository is being created sometime after the date of the
presentation, it may be helpful to have a little background on why I chose
to give this talk.

Several months earlier, club President, Fred Fernbach gave a talk about
creating applications for the Android operating system used in many
"smart" phones.

At some point he mentioned that he had created ten applications, but they
had been lost due to a hard disk problem. As a software developer, this
bothered me a lot.

Further, it contrasts starkly with my own recent experiences.

I too had a lot of code at risk. I too had a hard disk issue when the BIOS
was corrupted and my software based RAID array was messed up. I do backups,
so I was able to recover the machine with two week old data. I was able to
do better than that though. I was able to restore all of the code to
current simply by retrieving it from github.

Two hours for system restore. Thirty minutes for github. NO LOST DATA!

I felt I had to share this wonderful free resource, and thus I pushed
past my fear and anxiety and made the presentation! Baby steps to be sure,
but steps nonetheless.

Enjoy!
